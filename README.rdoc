This was an attempt on my part to migrate my site, wishlistery.com, to Ruby on Rails. I spent a good Sunday on it
and was running into problems, so I decided to shelve it and continue on at a later date.

On a side note; if anyone has experience with LazyLoad and RoR, please let me know! I need some help!
